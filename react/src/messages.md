## Make One-Time Messages

You can create one-time messages that will trigger a function on a particular canister just once at some point in the future.

After that, the message is removed from the queue.

You can always remove the message from the queue by pressing the red delete button to the right.

Note that messages cost 0.1 DETI to send, and 0.0000001 DETI every 10 seconds to check between now and when your message goes out. So a message will cost 0.0008640 for each day between now and when it goes out. A message sent a year hence would cost about (.000864 \* 365 + 0.1 =) 0.41 DETI.

If you want to send messages on a regular schedule, click `Schedules` from the top menu.
