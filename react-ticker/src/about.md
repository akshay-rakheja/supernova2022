## Is DeTi Working?

This is a simple reference implementation to demonstrate receiving pulses from Decentralized time.

1. Click on the canister ID below to copy to your clipbord.
2. Paste the canister field of a new schedule, period or one-time message form on [DeTi](https://fl5mh-daaaa-aaaap-qalja-cai.ic0.app/)
3. Click on the function you would like to invoke below to copy the name to your clipboard.
4. Paste in the function field of the schedule.
5. Get a cup of coffee!
6. When your scheduled event is supposed to fire, take a look back here and see if the proper number incremented!

(Other people may be running tests using these as well - try pressing `Reset` to clear the number to make more obvious your event firing).

Happy testing!
